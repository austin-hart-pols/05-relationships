# Overview: empirical relationships

.pull-left[

### Goals
1. Characterize how the distribution of the outcome variable (Y) responds, on average, to changes in the exposure variable (X).  
2. Differentiate systematic changes from those that could result from random chance.   
3. Condition out selection bias


]

.pull-right[
### Keys for beginners
- Correctly identify outcome (Y) versus exposure (X) variable.  
- Correctly identify measurement scale of both vars.  
- Focus on explanation; don't get caught in R code.

# Tabular analysis

- **When to use it?**
  - Categorical outcome (Y)  
  - Categorical exposure (X)  

- **How?**
  - Generate contingency table (cross-tabs)  
  - Assess independence of factors using $\chi^2$ test

- **Key points**
  - Report relative frequencies.  
  - Construct table correctly.  

---
# The motivation


### Independent or not?
- Construct a contingency (cross-tabs) table. 
- What is "the distribution of Y" here?
- Where is a "change in X" in this table? 
- Define statistical independence


---
# Statistical test


### Chi-square test of independence

- Null: X and Y are independent

$$
\chi^2_{df} = \sum \frac{(O-E)^2}{E}
$$
  - $O=$ observed frequency in each cell
    
  - $E=\frac{row.total}{grand.total}*col.total$  
    Expected frequency in each cell assuming independence.
    
  - $df=(x.cats-1)*(y.cats-1)$  
    Degrees of freedom

```
]

.pull-right[
In the full sample, 80% of Beninese say democracy is always best and the others are split roughly evenly between the other two. The distribution of preferences is roughly equal across urban and rural respondents, though rural Beninese express slightly less support for democracy. 

There is no evidence of a statistically significant relationship $(\chi^2_2=0.15,~p = 0.93)$.

# Assessing differences

.pull-left[

- **When to use it?**
  - Continuous outcome measure (Y)  
  - Qualitative exposure (X)  

- **How?**
  - Calculate and compare summary stats (i.e., group means)  
  - Significance test: $t$ or $F$
  
- **Key points**
  - Report and compare the means!

The figure plots the representation of women in the lower house of parliament (% seats held) by the use of proportional voting (PR). Among countries that use PR systems, women hold 28 percent of seats, on average. In countries without PR voting, women hold only 20 percent of seats, a difference of 8 points. It is unlikely that we observe this difference by chance alone $(t=-4.9,~p < 0.001)$.

# Linear trends

- **When to use it?**
  - Continuous outcome (Y)  
  - Continuous exposure var (X)  

- **How?**
  - Estimate line of best fit: $E(Y_i|X_i) = \alpha + \beta(X_i)$  
  - Focus on sign, magnitude and significance of $\beta$

- **Key points**
  - Using straight line to describe a trend.  


---
# The motivation

### Linear independence

- What is the "distribution of Y" here?  
- Define the change in X.  
- What constitutes independence?


---
# Refresher: lines

> Model the expected (mean) value of the outcome variable as a linear function of the exposure variable.

$$ E(Y_i|X_i) = \alpha + \beta(X_i) $$

### Parameters of a line

- Intercept, $\alpha$   
  $E(Y_i|X_i = 0) =\alpha$

- Slope, $\beta$  
  $E(\Delta Y_i| \Delta X_i) = \beta$

### OLS in R

```{r}
# Estimate
  e1 <- lm(yvar ~ xvar, data)

# Visualize
  plot(yvar ~ xvar, data)
  abline(e1)
  
# Table
  library(stargazer)
  stargazer(e1, type = 'text', keep.stat = 'n')
```
]

---
# Multiple regression

### Sources of error

- Random noise  

- Bias due to confounding


---
# How to mitigate bias

### Conditioning on confounders  

.pull-left[
#### What to include?

1. Identify confounding variables
  - It's a known or likely cause of Y.  
  - AND it's a cause or correlate of X.  
2. Add them as controls in your model.  

#### What to avoid?
- Alternate measures of X. 
- Overfitting. 
]

.pull-right[
#### But how?
```{r}
# Estimate
  e1 <- lm(yvar ~ xvar, data) # unconditional
  e2 <- lm(yvar ~ xvar + control1 + control2, data)
  
# Table
  library(stargazer)
  stargazer(e1, e2, type = 'text', keep.stat = 'n')
```

# Presentation

.pull-left[
```{r, echo=F, eval=T, results = 'asis'}
  mods = list(
    e1 = lm(epi_epi ~ wdi_wip, df2),
    e2 = lm(epi_epi ~ wdi_wip + wdi_gdpcapcur + vdem_libdem, df2)
  )
  
  stargazer::stargazer(mods, dep.var.labels = c('EPI index'), covariate.labels = c('Women in Parl', 'GDP per capita', 'Lvl of democracy'), type = 'html', style = 'apsr', keep.stat = 'n') 
```
]

.pull-right[
Models 1 and 2 show the unconditional and conditional relationship between women in parliament and EPI scores. We find that a 1-percentage point increase in women's rep is associated with a 0.355 increase in EPI score on average. The estimate attenuates after controlling for GDP and democracy, where EPI increases by 0.157 for the same change in women's rep. Both estimates are significant at 5%.
